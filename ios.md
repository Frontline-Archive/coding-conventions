* Method Commenting:
	* Use Document Style method comments

```
/**
    MethodName
    Author : FirstName LastName
    Edited by : FirstName LastName(if any)
    Last Date Modified : 8/21/13

    @Description  Write stuff here

*/
```

* Use inside method comments:

```
// More description here as needed
```


* Classes and methods should follow Law Of Demeter:
	* Methods should do minimal amount of work possible.
	* Methods and Classes should be broken up so they are testable with TDD by themselves.

* TDD:
	* Stories are not “Done” unless there are TDD tests to go along with it.
* Naming Conventions:
	* Use Camel Case
* More To come later: (Event naming, variable naming, method naming)
